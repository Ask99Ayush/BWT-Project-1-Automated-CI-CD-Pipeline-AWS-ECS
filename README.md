 Automated CI/CD Pipeline for Scalable Microservices Deployment using Jenkins & AWS ECS

 Problem Statement

 Manual deployment of containerized applications on AWS ECS is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient, especially when scaling microservices. It introduces delays, inconsistencies, and operational overhead. To overcome these challenges, there is a need for a fully automated CI/CD   
 pipeline that ensures:

 Faster, reliable, and consistent deployments with minimal manual intervention.
 Automated testing and rollback mechanisms to enhance reliability.
 Seamless scalability with AWS ECS for handling high traffic loads efficiently.

 Solution Overview

 This project automates the deployment of microservices using Jenkins, Docker, AWS ECS, and ALB. It includes:

 GitHub integration with Jenkins using webhooks.

 Automated Docker image build & push to AWS ECR.

 ECS task update & service restart via Jenkins.

 AWS ALB to route traffic to microservices.

  Tech Stack & Tools Used

- Jenkins - CI/CD automation tool
- Docker - Containerization of microservices
- AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service) - Managed container orchestration
- AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry) - Secure image storage
- AWS ALB (Application Load Balancer) - Load balancing and routing
- GitHub - Source code management & webhooks
- Webhooks - Triggering CI/CD pipeline automatically

 Setup & Installation

 Prerequisites
- AWS account with IAM permissions
- Jenkins server installed and configured
- GitHub repository setup
- Docker installed locally

Step-by-Step Setup
1. Clone the Repository
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Kunalkthalautiya/Project-1-Automated-CI-CD-Pipeline-AWS-ECS.git
   cd Automated-CI-CD-Pipeline
   ```
2. Set up AWS ECS Cluster & Task Definition
3. Configure AWS ECR for storing Docker images
4. Set up Jenkins with required plugins
5. Create a Jenkins Pipeline Script (Jenkinsfile)
6. Configure Webhook in GitHub
7. Test the Pipeline with Code Push

CI/CD Pipeline Workflow

1. Developer Pushes Code - Developer commits & pushes code to GitHub.
2. Webhook Triggers Jenkins - GitHub webhook notifies Jenkins.
3. Jenkins Pulls Code & Builds Docker Image
4. Pushes Docker Image to AWS ECR
5. Updates ECS Task Definition & Restarts ECS Service
6. AWS ALB Routes Traffic to Updated Microservice
7. User Accesses the Updated Microservice
